# nRF24-Esk8-Remote

Control your electric skateboard with your very own Arduino controlled remote. This repository contains the needed software for the remote and the receiver, however you will need to install a few Arduino Libraries in order to compile the Arduino sketches. The Arduino IDE comes with most of the needed libraries, but you will ned to manually install U8g2lib and RF24.

You can find the 3D-models for the remote (STL files) on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2454391 and read more about the project on: https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/simple-3d-printed-nrf-remote-arduino-controlled/28543
